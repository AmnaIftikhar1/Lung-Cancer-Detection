# Lung-Cancer-Detection

The code is designed to predict lung cancer based on input features provided by the user. It uses a Random Forest classifier for the 
prediction. The user is prompted to enter information such as age, gender, smoking status, and other features related to lung cancer risk 
factors. The model then processes this data, makes a prediction, and outputs whether lung cancer is detected or not.
